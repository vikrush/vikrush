<b>🎥 All-in-One Video & Audio Downloader</b>
<p>
    I'm building a platform where users can download video and audio from multiple platforms like YouTube, Facebook,
    Instagram, etc. all in one place. My goal is to create a clean and simple UI, with options to choose the format and
    quality you want to download in. Over time, I plan to add features like playlist downloads, subtitle support, batch
    processing, and possibly browser extensions and apps to make this experience even more seamless.
</p>
<b>🤖 AI-Powered Research & Creative Platform</b>
<p>
    Using an open-source AI model, I want to build a system that can search the internet, surface credible sources,
    perform in-depth analysis, and present structured insights. It can also generate perfect images, video, and audio.
    With real-time voice interaction and camera vision, this platform provides an experience more akin to talking to a
    knowledgeable assistant.
</p>
<b>🌦 Modern Weather App with AI Assistant</b>
<p>
    I want to create a modern weather app that doesn't just show temperature and rain chances. The app will provide
    detailed data on wind conditions, air quality, sun and moon positions, and a 14-day forecast. To make the
    information more practical, AI analysis will provide personalized suggestions, such as whether the day is good for
    farming or traveling.
</p>
<b>🌱 Smart Farming with IoT and AI</b>
<p>
    Agriculture is a field where technology can have a huge impact, and I want to contribute to this with a smart
    agriculture platform. This project will integrate IoT devices to collect real-time data such as soil moisture,
    humidity, and temperature, and then combine them with weather forecasts to provide AI-powered advice. Farmers will
    be able to remotely control IoT devices—either manually or automatically—such as turning on or off irrigation
    motors. The alert system will notify users when water levels are too high or too low, or temperatures have exceeded
    safe limits. It will send recommendations for irrigation, fertilizer, and pest management based on the collected
    data, making farming more efficient and sustainable. All of these features aim to help farmers save resources,
    respond quickly to difficult situations, and practice more efficient and sustainable farming.
</p>
<b>📱 Privacy-First Custom Android ROM</b>
<p>
    I plan to work on a custom Android ROM focused on privacy, security, and user control. The ROM will remove
    unnecessary trackers, ads, and Google dependencies, while offering features like device spoofing, IP and location
    masking, and a clean, minimal interface. Over time, I’d like to integrate lightweight AI features for offline use,
    making the ROM not only privacy-focused but also smart and adaptable to user needs.
</p>
<b>🔧 Continuous Improvements</b>
<p>
    All of my projects are built with a strong focus on security, user privacy, and reliability. I'll continually work
    to fix bugs, add new features, and improve each platform. Alongside development, I'll also create supporting tools
    and apps that make the overall experience even more seamless. My goal is not only to create projects, but also to
    maintain and evolve them into better and more reliable solutions over time.
